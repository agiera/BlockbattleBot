This package contains the definition of the basic interfaces for an
agent/environement simulator. It is based on <i>page</i> definition from
Russell & Norvig (1995).

<h2>Description:</h2>

<p>Classes with the {@link lnsc.page.Environment} interface are considered as
environements or artificial worlds and classes with the {@link lnsc.page.Agent}
interface are considered artificial animated objects (intelligent or not).
Agents are usually placed into an environement class and it is that class that
allows the agent to take actions into the world and that provides the agent with
the current state.</p>

<p>The environement must provide the agent with a class implementing the {@link
lnsc.page.State} interface as well as classes implementing the {@link
lnsc.page.ActionGenerator} interface and the {@link lnsc.page.Action}
respectively. An environement usually also have a class with the {@link
lnsc.page.StateGenerator} interface to generate the next states once an agent as
choosen an action.</p>

<p>Since some agents are doing search internally (specially in deterministic
environment), an agent can also have its own sets of classes implementing
{@link lnsc.page.State}, {@link lnsc.page.Action}, {@link
lnsc.page.StateGenerator}, and {@link lnsc.page.ActionGenerator} to do its
internal search. The state generator is first use to transform the environment
state into its internal state, and it can then use its own set of classes to
perform a search in its <i>head</i>. Those classes depend on the amount of
knowledge an agent might have of the environment as opposed to the environment
classes who have full knowledge of it. The environment itself may have two sets
of states and actions, one for its internal model of the world, and one with
only the information accessible to the agent.
{@link lnsc.page.StateRepresentation} and {@link lnsc.page.ActionRepresentation}
interfaces are for agents and/or algorithms who require real-vector state or
action representation.</p>

<p>The package also has some generic environement simulator that work on any
state/action/generator environment with certain properties as well as some
generic search and learning algorithms that work on any
state/action/generator/representation agent.</p>
